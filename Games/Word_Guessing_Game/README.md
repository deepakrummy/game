## **Description 📃** 
This game is a word-guessing game where the player tries to guess letters to form a hidden word. The player has a limited number of attempts, and each correct guess reveals the corresponding letters in the word. The player wins if they correctly guess the entire word within the allowed attempts, and the game progresses to the next word. The player's wins and losses are tracked and displayed.

## **functionalities 🎮** 
The game starts by displaying a hidden word with blank spaces representing the letters to be guessed.
The player can input a letter by pressing a key on the keyboard.
The game checks if the input is a valid letter and if it has not been guessed before.
If the input is valid, the game updates the guessed letters, increases the number of attempts, and checks if the round is won or lost.
If the round is won, the game increments the wins counter, moves to the next word, and resets the attempts and guessed letters.
If the round is lost, the game increments the losses counter, moves to the next word, and resets the attempts and guessed letters.
The game updates the display after each guess, showing the guessed letters, the remaining attempts, and the game board with revealed letters.
The player can continue playing by guessing more words until all the words in the list have been guessed.

## **How to play? 🕹️**
When the game starts, you will see a hidden word represented by blank spaces.
Use your keyboard to input a letter by pressing any key.
Make sure to input only single alphabetic characters (A-Z) as guesses.
Each correct guess will reveal the corresponding letters in the word.
The game will update the display to show the guessed letters and the remaining attempts.
If you guess all the letters in the word before running out of attempts, you win the round.
If you run out of attempts without guessing the word correctly, you lose the round.
After each round, the game will move to the next word automatically.
The wins and losses counter will be updated accordingly.
Continue playing until you have guessed all the words or as long as you like.
