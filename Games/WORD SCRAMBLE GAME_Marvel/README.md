## How we made it?
We have used :
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Inspiration
Over  the past few years ,The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) has put out a ton of great entertainment. Thus , we wanted to build a game that will create a twist on the classic word game ' Scramble' , based on MARVEL FILMS. We all love the MARVEL CINEMATIC UNIVERSE

## What it does
This is a word scramble game where the player have to guess the answers by properly arranging the letters of the answers that are scrambled or jumbled up , related to the questions of the  MARVEL FILMS .
