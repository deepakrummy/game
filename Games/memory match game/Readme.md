How to play?

Sure! Here's a step-by-step guide on how to play the Memory Match game:

1.Setup:
Open the Memory Match game in your web browser. The game board will consist of a grid of face-down cards. Each card has an emoji image hidden behind it.

2.Objective:
The objective of the game is to find and match all pairs of cards with the same emoji image.

3.Gameplay:

Click on any face-down card to flip it over.
After flipping one card, click on another face-down card to see if they match.
If the two cards have the same emoji image, they will stay face-up, and you've found a match!
If the two cards do not have the same emoji image, they will flip back face-down.
Keep flipping cards and remembering the images behind them to find all the matching pairs.
4.Winning:
Continue flipping cards until all pairs are matched and face-up.

Make mental notes or create associations to help you remember the positions of the cards with the same images.
Be patient and stay focused; matching all the cards may take a few attempts.
