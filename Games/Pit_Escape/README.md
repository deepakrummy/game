Escape the pit inhabited by biologically improbable snakes.

Make your way through 9 levels of varying difficulty. If you get caught, you go back one level. The game is turn-based, constantly giving you an opportunity to think.

Controls: arrows to move (or WASD, or HJKL like in Vi).

Cheat: press ] to skip level.

Browser support: latest Chrome, Chromium are good. Recent Firefox is okay.
