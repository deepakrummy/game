- Once you see that you are safe from the attacks, attack blindly at the opponents. No matter if any shot is missed, some will still be hit and the enemies will be gone. This will increase the chance of destroying the opponents and scoring maximum points.
- To gain the highest score possible, focus on all the controls, move left or right as needed and shoot the opponent to destroy them all.
