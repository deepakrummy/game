Staccato is a racing game
It was at first inspired by Supercars on Amiga, then I figured out that using WebGL meant that the viewpoint could be easily changed.
Default controls are WASD for player 1, arrow keys for player 2, F1 and Page Down to change the camera. Keys can be modified through the menu.
