## HTML Code Overview üåê

The HTML file (`index.html`) provides the structure for the game interface. It includes elements for displaying the level, score, and the WebGL canvas where the 3D scene is rendered. Additionally, it links to external CSS and JavaScript files for styling and functionality.

## CSS Styling üé®

The CSS file (`style.css`) defines the visual appearance of the game interface. It sets the background color, font styles, and positions various elements such as the HUD (heads-up display) for level and score information. The canvas is styled to be positioned absolutely, ensuring proper rendering of the 3D scene.

## JavaScript Logic üß†

The JavaScript file (`index.js`) contains the game logic and functionality. It initializes the Three.js scene, sets up the camera and lighting, creates spinning cubes, handles mouse interactions for clicking on cubes, manages scoring and level progression, and renders explosion effects when cubes are clicked. The code is well-commented to explain each step in detail.

## Playing the Game üöÄ

To play the game, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser that supports WebGL. Once the game interface loads, follow the on-screen instructions to click on the spinning cubes and score points. Advance through the levels by clearing all the targets and aim to reach the final level to achieve victory!
