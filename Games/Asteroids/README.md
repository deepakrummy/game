## **Description 📃**
Asteroids is a classic arcade game where the player controls a spaceship in a space environment filled with asteroids. The objective of the game is to destroy as many asteroids as possible while avoiding collisions with them.
The game is typically played on a 2D plane represented by a canvas. The player's spaceship can rotate, thrust forward, and shoot bullets. The asteroids move in random directions and can vary in size. When a bullet collides with an asteroid, it splits into smaller fragments until eventually destroyed.

## **How to play? 🕹️**
<!-- add the steps how to play games -->
The player earns points for destroying asteroids, and the game becomes progressively challenging as the number and speed of asteroids increase. Colliding with an asteroid or being hit by an asteroid's fragment reduces the player's lives. The game ends when all lives are lost.
