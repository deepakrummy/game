## **Description üìÉ**
Blackjack, also known as 21, is a popular card game typically played in casinos. The objective of the game is to have a hand value closer to 21 than the dealer‚Äôs hand without exceeding 21. Here‚Äôs a detailed description of how the game is played:

Objective
Players aim to get a hand total of 21 or as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it.
The goal is to have a higher hand total than the dealer without busting (exceeding 21).

Card Values
Number cards (2 through 10) are worth their face value.
Face cards (King, Queen, Jack) are worth 10 points each.
Aces can be worth either 1 or 11 points, whichever benefits the hand more.

## **How to play? üïπÔ∏è**
Game Setup

Players and Dealer: The game is played between one or more players and a dealer.

Betting: Each player places an initial bet in the betting circle before any cards are dealt.

Dealing the Cards
Initial Deal: The dealer deals two cards to each player and two cards to themselves. One of the dealer's cards is face up (the "upcard"), and the other is face down (the "hole card").
Blackjack Check: If a player or the dealer has an Ace and a 10-point card as their initial two cards, they have blackjack and win immediately unless the dealer also has blackjack, resulting in a push.

Player Decisions

Hit: Take an additional card to try to get closer to 21.

Say "Hit" or signal to the dealer (in physical games) to receive another card.

Stand: Keep your current hand and end your turn.

Say "Stand" or signal to the dealer to stop receiving cards.

Double Down: Double your initial bet, receive one more card, and then stand.

Place an additional bet equal to your original bet and receive one more card.

Split: If your first two cards are of the same value, you can split them into two separate hands.

Place an additional bet equal to your original bet, and each new hand gets a second card.

Surrender: Forfeit half your bet and end your turn early (if the option is available).

Announce "Surrender" to the dealer.

Dealer's Turn
Reveal Hole Card: The dealer flips over their hole card.
Hit or Stand: The dealer must hit until their hand totals 17 or higher. If the dealer has a "soft" 17 (a hand containing an Ace valued as 11, totaling 17), some casinos require the dealer to hit.
Winning and Losing

Blackjack: If a player has blackjack (an Ace and a 10-point card), they win 1.5 times their bet unless the dealer also has blackjack, in which case it's a push.

Comparison:

If your hand total is closer to 21 than the dealer's without exceeding 21, you win and are paid 1:1 on your bet.
If your hand total exceeds 21, you bust and lose your bet.
If the dealer busts, all remaining players win.
If your hand total is the same as the dealer‚Äôs, it's a push, and your bet is returned.
