Rules:
Card Values: Number cards (2-10) are worth their face value, face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10, and Aces can be worth 1 or 11.

Objective: Beat the dealer by having a hand value closer to 21 without exceeding 21.

Gameplay:
Both the player and the dealer are dealt two cards initially.

The player’s cards are both face up, while the dealer has one card face up and one card face down.

The player can choose to "Hit" (take another card) or "Stand" (end their turn).

If the player’s hand exceeds 21, they "bust" and lose the game.

After the player stands, the dealer reveals their face-down card and hits until their hand is 17 or higher.

If the dealer busts, the player wins. If neither busts, the hand closer to 21 wins.
