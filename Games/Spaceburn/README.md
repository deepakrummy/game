## Gameplay

You control a character with a jetpack, in an asteroid field.
You have no weapons...except your jetpack, which spouts flames!

You fly around, and destroy asteroids by using your jetpack's flames.

The spacebar control helps people maneuver better.



Read on. In the sketch, the jetpack man's already in the air, and has turned around, with his jetpack facing the asteroid. Once the asteroid moves closer, or the jetpack's flames move further (by the player hitting up to power the jetpack), the asteroid breaks apart.
