MrFakeGame is a simple online JavaScript game where the objective is to score 750 points within 45 seconds. Players control a character on the right side of the screen using the WASD or arrow keys. The enemy remains on the left side. By pressing the space bar, players can send a projectile towards the enemy, earning around 35 points per hit. Only one projectile can be sent at a time. The game ends when either the target score is reached or the time runs out.
