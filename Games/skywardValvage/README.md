So what is skywardValvage??
So this game is simply like starwars ship something like that, and the enemy you must kill, just simple like that 

# About this game
So i make this game is like 5 hours maybe, for making a models for plane, enemy, and background so i hope you guys enjoyed it
but you know. the faster a game is launched, the less complete the features in the game are, 
so I think I will continue to update this game with gameplay features and maybe in the future I will give some sound effects

# Your purpose
so in this game you can't do too much because it's really just been made, 
so for a while the features it has are collecting as many scores as possible

# How to play and install
- you guys can clone this diretory or copy paste my code and don't forget the images you guys need btw the sounds i will make that soon so just wait :D
