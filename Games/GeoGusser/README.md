## **Description ðŸ“ƒ**

- It is a geography based location-guessing game where the users would have to guess the country location in which they are in from the Google Street View imagery. It takes the players to a journey around the world and tests their abilities to recognize their surroundings.

## **Functionalities ðŸŽ®**
<!-- add functionalities over here -->
- Players would be given a random street view to manuver into and they would have to identify on which country they are in based on the rendered surroundings. 
- The players would have to identify the key features and geo-trails from the street view, such as the street names, languages, architecture, and so on, and based on that, they would have to make a guess about where they are.
- Players would then have to mention their guess on the submit prompt!, and based on weather their guess is correct or not, they would be awarded the required points. 
- The users can create highscores and can go on endless trails and enhance their location guessing abilities.
