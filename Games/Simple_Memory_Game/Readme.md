Memory Game

## **Description 📃**

A Basic 4x2 Memory Game. Which depicts your score of your memory retention and concentration power.
The goal is to find all matching pairs of cards by flipping them over two at a time.
I have kept the game as simple and light as possible, so that anyone can get it easily despite of their age.

## **functionalities 🎮**

It contains a Score Board which counts +1 if you picked up the write combinations. And counts -1 for every wrong combinations picked.
It shows a result at the end of the game for the intended pun.
You also get a reset button. Don't worry my game wont give you a similar card at the same place <3

## **How to play? 🕹️**

Start with picking up two cards at a time. The Cards will be in shuffled order.
If you picked up the right combination or the matching two cards at a single pick, you will get +1 in your score.
If you picked up the wrong combination, you will get -1 in your score.
