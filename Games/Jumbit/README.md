You are a small spark of flame trapped in a cold cave. Travelling through a breeze of wind, how long can you survive the unstable frozen formations in your way?

### About JS13K
Js13kGames is a JavaScript coding competition for HTML5 game developers. The fun part of the compo is the file size limit set to 13 kilobytes. Theme for 2014 is The Elements: Earth, Water, Air and Fire. The competition started at 13:00 CEST, 13th August and will end at 13:00 CEST, 13th September 2014. 

### About the code
The code started as pretty organized, then as the time pressure increased had to write to do some shortcuts to finish up. Will be refactoring the code gradually, but all in all it should be pretty readable. If you have questions feel free to ask! :)
