# Quantum Maze

Quantum Maze is a unique and extraordinary game that combines classic maze navigation with principles of quantum mechanics, including superposition, entanglement, and quantum state collapse. Your objective is to navigate through a maze where walls and paths can change based on quantum states and reach the end of the maze to win.

## How to Play

1. **Objective:** Navigate the player (a yellow square) through the maze to reach the endpoint.
2. **Movement:** Use the arrow keys to move the player:
   - `Arrow Up`: Move up
   - `Arrow Down`: Move down
   - `Arrow Left`: Move left
   - `Arrow Right`: Move right
3. **Quantum Walls:** 
   - Walls can exist in multiple states simultaneously.
   - Get close to walls to observe them and collapse their state, determining if they are passable.
4. **Entangled Paths:**
   - Certain paths are linked. Moving on one path may affect another.
   - Strategize your moves to manage these changes.
5. **Superposition Gates:** (Future Enhancement)
   - Gates require the player to be in two places at once.
   - Split the player's state to pass through these gates.

## Functionalities

### Current Features

- **Quantum Walls:** Walls change state based on the player's proximity.
- **Player Movement:** Navigate the maze using arrow keys.
- **Maze Rendering:** The maze is dynamically generated with walls and paths.

### Future Enhancements

- **Superposition Gates:** Implement gates that require splitting the player's state.
- **Entangled Paths:** Develop paths that dynamically change state in relation to each other.
- **Levels:** Add multiple levels with increasing complexity.
- **Animations and Sound:** Integrate animations for wall collapsing and background music for an immersive experience.
