## Tetris Game

This is a simple Tetris game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**How to Play:**

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Use the arrow keys to move the tetrimino (left, right, down) and the up key to rotate it.
3. Clear lines by filling them entirely with blocks.
4. Avoid stacking blocks too high; the game ends if a new tetrimino can't spawn.

**Features:**

* Classic tetrimino shapes.
* Basic movement and rotation controls.
* Line clearing with score updates.

**Getting Started:**

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

**Customization:**

* You can modify the game's look and feel by editing the CSS styles (`style.css`).
* Adjust game logic and behavior within the JavaScript code (`script.js`).

**Note:**

This is a basic implementation. More features like sound effects and level progression can be added with further development.
