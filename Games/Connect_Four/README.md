## Description

Connect Four is a classic two-player board game where the objective is to connect four of your colored pieces in a row, column, or diagonal before your opponent does.

This project is a simple implementation of the Connect Four game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. The game starts with the random selection of player1 or player2.
3. Click on any of the seven columns at the top of the game board to drop a red or yellow color into that column.
4. The color will fall to the lowest available row in the selected column.
5. The game will automatically switch to the other player's turn.
6. Players take turns dropping their respective colored pieces until one player successfully connects four pieces in a row, column, or diagonal.
7. If a player connects four pieces, an alert will pop up to declare that player as the winner.
8. If neither player connects four pieces and the board is full, the game will end in a draw.
9. To play again a start a new game window is also implemented which also shows the winner of the previous game.
