# drumkit-project

this is a beginner level project on drum kit .this project is made by using html,css,javascript.

The point of this project is to have each key, when pressed, make a corresponding drum noise. 
It also uses CSS transitions and animations to make the project more interactive to the user.
I completed this project earlier in my JavaScript learning phase. I found it quite confusing because
I had never used the HTML audio API or the selection of DOM elements using the date-key attribute.

JavaScript Used:
DOM Manipulation
Control Structures
HTML Audio API
JavaScript CSS Manipulation
addEventListener
