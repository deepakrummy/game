# Word Association Game

Welcome to the Word Association Game! This is a simple yet engaging game where players have to input words that are associated with the previously entered word. Let's dive into how to play and what functionalities are included in the game.

## How to Play

1. **Start**: The game begins with a randomly selected word from a predefined list. This word serves as the starting point for the game.
2. **Input**: Players need to input a word that starts with the last letter of the previous word. For example, if the previous word is "apple," the next word could be "elephant" or "eggplant."
3. **Validation**: The game validates the entered word to ensure it follows the rules. It checks if the word starts with the correct letter and if it's a valid word in the English language.
4. **Feedback**: If the word is valid, the game continues, and it displays a success message. Otherwise, it prompts the player to try again with a valid word.
5. **Repeat**: Players continue to input words, building a chain of associated words. The game keeps track of the word chain and ensures that each word is associated with the previous one.
