Under the Crypt
========

In this dungeon crawling tower defense game you play a paranormal researcher tasked with ridding an old crypt of its supernatural inhabitants. Try to survive as long as possible while defeating wave after wave of enemies. Because you will die a lot, you can choose between hard mode (permadeath) and normal mode.

The game is playable on both PCs and mobile devices and has been tested in recent Chrome and Firefox (both on GNU/Linux, Windows, and Android), Safari (iOS), IE 11 preview (Windows), and Silk (Android). It is recommended to switch off fullscreen in Firefox and IE due to rendering glitches.
