- Tilting Maze is an exciting and challenging game that tests your dexterity and problem-solving skills. In this game, you are presented with a maze consisting of intricate pathways and obstacles.

## _functionalities üéÆ_

- _Tilt Control_: Tilting mazes usually have a mechanism or control system that allows the player to tilt the playing surface. This can be achieved through manual manipulation, such as tilting the maze with your hands, or by using built-in controls like knobs or levers.

- _Physical Challenge_: Tilting mazes provide a physical challenge as players need to carefully manipulate the playing surface to control the movement of the object. This requires dexterity, coordination, and a good understanding of the maze's layout.
- _Quiz Administration_

- _Multiple Levels or Difficulty Settings_: Tilting mazes often offer multiple levels or difficulty settings to cater to different skill levels and provide a progressive challenge. Higher levels may feature more complex mazes, narrower pathways, or additional obstacles, requiring more precise control and strategic thinking.
