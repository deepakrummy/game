mission
=======
You play as Reverend Captain Lore Whitaker, a missionary en route to prefecture 461.


For centuries, successful missions have been founded on one simple concept: that the four elements describe both our terrestial lives and our spiritual lives. Easy to remember. Easy to spread to alien civilizations

Try to pick planets that might be habitable. If you don't like your current selection, you can hit the '...' button to search for more planets. This takes a turn, but doesn't waste fuel.
Ratings
When you visit a planet, you'll see a rating of 1-4 for each element. Three is ideal. All elements can be estimated from a visual inspection, so try to learn the relationship between the look of the planet and the ratings!
