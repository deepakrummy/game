Road The Game
===

Why did the chicken cross the road?




## The Game (& ideas)

* You earn scores for every shit you do (hit special cars, die fast (like a mupliplicator or something))
* Stupid sounds like MMOOOOONSTER KILL from Quake3
* Intro screen with basic howto
* Favicon
* A "storm"/lot of cars after x minutes (random), but with a x second countdown so that the player will see that he is dying soon
* Show current game difficulty (based on how fast the cars are)
* Motor cycles in between the cars (on every side) with half the width of a car and a max height
* Random bombs, hurricanes, Tsunami -> Connected to the "Storm"-Countdown so that a random SHIT FUCK will happen to the player
* Cooldown "display" for power-ups
* Use requestAnimationFrame so that the game pauses if the window is not active
* Spawn more power ups the faster the cars get
* Make the game scalable
* optimize for mobile -> touch control and bigger board
* Change the volume of the audio
* Check if audio is available in the current browser and disable it if its not
* Fade power-ups smoothly in
* Max amount of power-ups
* Max amount of speed



### Modes for the future

* Die fast, as much as possible
