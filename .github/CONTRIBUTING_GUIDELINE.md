## **File naming conventions 📁**
- Give unique name for your game that don't exist already. 
* Folder naming convention
    - ```Game_Name```  ex.  ```Tilting_Maze```,```Rock_Paper_Scissors``` (first letter should be capital and if you need space use underscore **_** )      
* files in the folder 
    - Main html file should be named as **index.html** , not something else like ```Tilting_Maze.html```
    - Game files - ```index.html``` , ```script.js``` , ```style.css```(not stictly to follow this but you should have separate file for each kind)
    - It is preferred if the main html file is directly added to the main folder of you game like ```Tilting_Maze/index.html``` along with other files like *style.css*, *script.js*
    - you can have other folders if you are having assets for your game 
    - Create```README.md``` for your Game using this [TEMPLATE](../Games/FOLDER_README_TEMPLATE.md).Although, it is not compulsory to follow this README template ,you can use your own *README* template whichever you prefer, to explain your Game
* naming convention for the screenshot you will add in ```assets/images```
    - Remember preview image should be in ```assets/images``` and not in main folder of Game itself.
    - name of image should be same as your game name
    - ex. ```Tilting_Maze.jpeg``` or .jpg or .png any of the image format, but don't add image format in the name itself , it is self-assigned to a image,you don't need to add it manually, otherwise it becomes ```Tilting_Maze.jpeg.jpeg```
    - There should be only one ScreenShot of the game in ```assets/images``` and that too with same name as the Game(Exactly Same).
* Note:-All Other data except the ScreenShot of your Game, should be in it's main folder , don't add it to other folders of the project.
